            <h1>Transforming T30: A User-Centric Redesign through Thoughtful UI/UX Design</h1>
            <div class="work-hero"></div>
            <i>A picture of me trying to figure out my research data using post-it notes</i>

        <div class="project-overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <p>T30 is a non-denominational Christian platform with daily devotionals and collective prayer times designed to help you build a consistent devotional life. Since its debut in 2020, T30's user base has grown into thousands, allowing people from all over the world to connect, pray and read the word daily.</p>

            <i>Just a heads-up: I'm not part of T30, and the opinions in this case study are all mine. Unlike the T30 designers, I don't have complete access to the user data that shaped their current design, the font type, images and the specific elements they used for their design. So, this case study isn't all-encompassing, and I'm not proposing T30 should switch to my redesign.</i>
            
            <h3>My goals for the redesign:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate a more engaging and seamless experience when it comes to devotion and staying connected</li>
                <li>To design a more personable and intuitive user interface</li>
                <li>To design through user empathy (HCD)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My goals for my own personal development:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to conduct and analyze user research, create flow charts and wireframes, design and prototype  through Figma</li>
                <li>Complete my first redesign project from start to finish while sticking to design principles</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The roles I assumed during the process of building this redesign:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>UI/UX Designer</li>
                <li>User Researcher</li>
                <li>Product Designer</li>
                <li>Data Analyst</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="problem-statement">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>While the current app design serves its purpose, it lacks key elements that could significantly enhance user engagement and community interaction. Users have expressed a desire for features such as testimonials, a community space, a journaling platform, and bookmark functionality to enrich their experience. To create a more vibrant and user-friendly platform, the redesign aims to seamlessly integrate these components, fostering a stronger sense of community and personal connection for believers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="audience">
            <h2>Target Audience Demographics </h2>
            <p>Among the 10 T30 users I interviewed, there were 4 males and 6 females. The age of the male users ranged from 25 to 31 years old, while the female users ranged from 22 to 30 years old. 90% are working class.</p>

            <p>To make this even more interesting, 30% of the users I interviewed ranked T30 in their Top 3 Most Used Application. Additionally, 50% of the people sampled uses T30 everyday.</p>

            <h4>And the fun goes on </h4>
            <p>I asked the 10 T30 users I interviewed,  What motivates you to use T30 regularly, and can you share specific aspects that </p>
            <br><i>contribute to a positive engagement experience?</i>

            <p>I collected a total of <b>30 adjectives.</b> <br>The top 3 adjectives were: <b> Daily, Positive, and Spiritual</b></p>

            <p>Following user research, it was found that 20% of our users are keen on having a testimonial section in the app. This unique addition not only showcases positive user experiences but also acts as a valuable tool for building connections. Through sharing personal stories, it offers motivation, serves as a beacon of hope, and spreads the uplifting spirit of faith.

            <p>As I brainstormed, I asked myself, 'Where's the perfect spot to showcase those amazing testimonials right off the bat?' The answer? The homepage! It's like giving users an immediate glimpse of encouragement, reminding them not to lose faith. This equally creates a user-friendly welcome that sets the tone for a seamless and enjoyable experience.</p>

            <h2>Feature #2: Community of Believers</h2>
            <p>After thorough user research, a notable finding surfaced: 20% of our users voiced a keen interest in having a community hub within the app. Understanding the value of nurturing connections and communal interactions among believers, we introduced the 'Community' feature. This fresh inclusion transcends traditional testimonials, establishing an interactive platform where users can share personal narratives, participate in enriching conversations, offer mutual support, and collectively enhance their faith journey.</p>
            <p>Following our user research, a common sentiment emerged among our users: they desired a space within the app where they could connect with fellow believers and share their experiences, insights, and support. One user expressed this desire, stating, "I love T30 for its daily devotionals, but having a community space within the app would be amazing. Connecting with fellow believers could make the experience even richer, allowing us to share insights and support each other on our faith journeys." In this section, we'll delve into how I made my design decisions, while prioritizing the needs of my end users </p>

            <div class="pic"></div>
            <i>A picture of some sketches</i>
            <p>During the brainstorming phase, I strategically considered the optimal placement for integrating the community feature, ensuring its immediate visibility. After careful deliberation, I concluded that the most effective approach was to substitute the 'Give' icon with the 'Community' icon. To streamline the interface and prevent overcrowding, I introduced the hamburger menu, thereby replacing the profile icon. This modification not only accommodated the inclusion of both the profile and give features but also alleviated clutter, creating additional space for the integration of other features under the 'More' section.</p>
            <p>I thought of having the T30 team create the communities instead of letting users do it. This way, we prevent the app from having too many or irrelevant groups. Users can easily join any community of their choice without the hassle of navigating through numerous options</p>

This innovative addition not only offers users a dedicated space for introspection but also enables them to record personal reflections or prayers inspired by the devotionals.

            <h2>Key Elements</h2>
            <p>I've spruced up the app with some design magic, paying homage to its roots while adding a dash of modern flair. Here's the lowdown on what makes it pop:
            Color Palette: My colors got a fresh coat, staying true to the originals but with a twist. It's like meeting an old friend with a stylish new wardrobe – familiar yet exciting.</p>
            <p class="no2">Typography: Words matter, and I've given mine a makeover. The fonts carry a vibe of the familiar while introducing a touch of sophistication, making every read a little more delightful.</p>

            <h2>User-Centric Approach</h2>
            <p>To enhance the user-centric experience for T30, I initiated an extensive user research phase. I engaged with the existing user base through interviews, and usability tests to gain valuable insights into their needs and pain points.</p>
            <h3>In-Depth Interviews </h3>
            <p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of user motivations and discover detailed insights, individual interviews were carried out with a diverse group of users. The comprehensive list of research inquiries utilized in these interviews is provided in the accompanying document. The outcomes from these interviews, which encompass essential quotes, stories, and evaluations of user motivations, challenges, unfulfilled requirements, and distinctive scenarios, are available in <span>(Here)</span>." These discoveries significantly influenced the redesign choices for T30.</p>

        <div class="usage">
            <h2>T30 USAGE</h2>

            </div>

            <h5>Design Strategy</h5>
            <p>The collective insights gathered <span>Here</span> informed a user-centric design strategy aimed at addressing specific user needs and concerns. Feature enhancements were prioritized based on both quantitative and qualitative findings.</p>
            
            <p>Moreover, a continuous feedback loop was established with users throughout the design iteration process, ensuring that their voices remained integral to shaping the final product. The design strategy, therefore, not only addresses current user expectations but also positions T30 for adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of user preferences.</p>

        <div class="design-choice">
            <h2>Rationale Behind Design Choices</h2>
            <h5>User-Centered Approach</h5>

            <p>Think of it as creating a perfect playlist personalized just for you. I took a user-centered approach, making sure the testimony section resonates with what users truly need and expect. It's not just design; it's a tailor-made experience crafted with your preferences in mind</p>

            <h5>Visual Hierarchy</h5>

            <p>Imagine crafting a visual story where every section has its own spotlight. That's what I did with testimonials. I strategically placed them, creating a visual roadmap for easy reading and maximum impact. It's about ensuring each testimonial has its moment in the spotlight for a seamless and impactful user experience.</p>

            <h5>Consistency with Branding</h5>

            <p>I made sure the testimony section not only looked good but also felt like it belonged. By keeping things in sync with the brand's style – colors, fonts, and all that jazz – the section seamlessly blends into the brand's vibe. It's like giving the audience a visual hug that's both familiar and stylish.</p>

            <h5>Visual Elements</h5>
            
            <p>I utilized annotations to highlight key features within the testimony section. These subtle visual cues serve as labels, ensuring users don't overlook the design gems we've carefully crafted</p>

            <h2>Considerations for Accessibility, Ensuring Inclusivity in Design</h2>

            <h5>Color Contrast Retention:</h5>

            <p>While the original color scheme remained unchanged to maintain brand identity, efforts were made to retain optimal color contrast for enhanced readability. This ensures that users with visual impairments can easily distinguish between text and background elements, promoting a more accessible reading experience</p>

            <h5>Text and Typography Adaptations</h5>

            <p>The typography system underwent subtle adjustments to accommodate a wider range of users. Font sizes were carefully chosen to enhance readability, and consideration was given to font styles that cater to users with varying visual abilities. This ensures that the devotional content remains accessible to all users, irrespective of their visual capabilities.</p>

            <h5>Interactive Elements and Focus States</h5>

            <p>Interactive elements, including buttons and navigation items, were designed with distinct focus states. This not only aids users navigating through the app using keyboards or assistive technologies but also ensures a clear and intuitive user experience for individuals with motor impairments.</p>

            <h5>Functional Enhancements with Accessibility in Mind </h5>

            <p>The newly added functionalities, such as the bookmark feature, note-taking page, and voice reader, were developed with a focus on accessibility. For instance, the voice reader that enhances accessibility by providing an auditory experience
                for users, particularly those with visual impairments or those who prefer to consume content through audio</p>
